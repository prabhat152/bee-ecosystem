# 🐝 Beehive Ecosystem Knowledge Graph  

## **📌 Project Purpose**  
This project visualizes a **Beehive Ecosystem** as a **Knowledge Graph** using **D3.js**.  
The graph represents relationships between various elements of a beehive, such as the **Queen Bee**, **Worker Bees**, **Honeycomb**, **Pollen**, **Predators**, and **Beekeepers**.  
It serves as an interactive and educational tool to understand the interconnected nature of bees and their environment.

## **🚀 How This Project Was Developed**  
This project was entirely developed **using ChatGPT's assistance**. Not a single line of code was hand-written!  
All code, including the `index.html` file, `README.md`, and step-by-step guidance for hosting on GitHub Pages, was generated through ChatGPT responses.  

### **🛠️ Technologies Used:**  
- **D3.js** for force-directed graph visualization  
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for structuring and styling  
- **GitHub Pages** for hosting

## **📝 Prompts Used to Develop This Project**  
To generate this project, the following prompts were used in ChatGPT:

1. **Initial Request for D3.js Graph:**  
   > "Create a D3.js force-directed graph that visualizes a knowledge graph as triples (subject → predicate → object).  
   > Use labeled edges to represent relationships between entities.  
   > The graph should be interactive, with nodes and links dynamically arranged.  
   > Create at least 25 nodes and 30 links.  
   > Show the direction of the relationship.  
   > Use yellow, green & red colour coding.  
   > The topic is to visualize a beehive ecosystem and its surroundings in its entirety."  

2. **Hosting on GitHub Pages:**  
   > "Subsequently, I would like to expose the beehive knowledge graph through GitHub HTML pages.  
   > I am not an expert using GitHub.  
   > Help me with the steps involved.  
   > My username on GitHub is prabhat152.  
   > I use Visual Studio to manage code on GitHub."  

3. **Creating this README file:**  
   > "Create a `README.md` file that includes the purpose of this project and also how this project was developed using ChatGPT assistance and the prompts I used.  
   > Also include the fact that even the README doc is created using ChatGPT and not a single line of code is hand-written."
